#2) the original code shows the usage of random list in detail. 
# It's friendly to beginners, you can cleaerly understand how to use the element of list.
# The method provided by ChatGPT is shorter.
# It combined some steps, which may be hard to understand at first.

    # At this point, the list contains exactly one door: either the player's initial choice (if it's the winning door)
    # or the winning door (if it's not the player's original choice). The player "switches" to the other door.
    my_door_choice = all_door_options_list[0]  # The player switches to the other remaining door

    # If the player's new door choice is the winning door, increment the win counter
    if my_door_choice == secret_winning_door:

# After all repetitions, calculate the probability of winning by switching doors
i_won/reps  # This gives the proportion of times the player won by switching

# ChatGPT explains the Monte Hall problem very clearly, 
# including how to set up the list and how to run through the code.
# Its rewrite version shows another way of solving the problems, you can learn from it.
# It explaination of the "Markovian ChatBot" code was too long,
# which makes the reading hard to continue. 
# However, i can still understand the most part.
# in conclusion, ChatBot is a very useful and helpful tool for coding. 
# However, you cannot rely on it too much, since the information it offers is usually too long.

# 7)Initially, I didnâ€™t think that data statistics needed the help of AI tools.
# I thought that it was enough to just use traditional tools such as Excel for calculations.
#vBut in fact, since I took this course, I learned that using coding to perform data statistics can make things very simple and clear.
# And AI is a very easy-to-use tool that can quickly organize and interpret data, greatly reducing the amount of work on people.
